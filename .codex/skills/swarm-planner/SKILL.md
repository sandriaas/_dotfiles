# Swarm-Ready Planner

Create implementation plans with explicit task dependencies optimized for parallel agent execution.

## Core Principles

1. **Explore Codebase**: Investigate architecture, patterns, existing implementations, dependencies, and frameworks in use.
2. **Fresh Documentation First**: Use Context7 for ANY external library, framework, or API before planning tasks
3. **Explicit Dependencies**: Every task declares what it depends on, enabling maximum parallelization
4. **Atomic Tasks**: Each task is independently executable by a single agent
5. **Review Before Yield**: A subagent reviews the plan for gaps before finalizing

## Process

### 1. Research & Documentation

**Codebase investigation:**
- Architecture, patterns, existing implementations
- Dependencies and frameworks in use

**Documentation retrieval (REQUIRED for external dependencies):**

Use Context7 skill to fetch current docs for any libraries/frameworks or APIs that are or will be used in project

This ensures version-accurate APIs, correct parameters, and current best practices.

### 2. Clarify Ambiguities

When anything is unclear or could reasonably be done multiple ways:
- Stop and ask clarifying questions immediately
- Do not make assumptions about scope, constraints, or priorities
- Questions should reduce risk and eliminate ambiguity

### 3. Create Dependency-Aware Plan

Structure the plan with explicit task dependencies using this format:

#### Task Dependency Format

Each task MUST include:
- **id**: Unique identifier (e.g., `T1`, `T2.1`)
- **depends_on**: Array of task IDs that must complete first (empty `[]` for root tasks)
- **description**: What the task accomplishes
- **location**: File paths involved
- **validation**: How to verify completion

**Example:**
```
T1: [depends_on: []] Create database schema migration
T2: [depends_on: []] Install required packages
T3: [depends_on: [T1]] Create repository layer
T4: [depends_on: [T1]] Create service interfaces
T5: [depends_on: [T3, T4]] Implement business logic
T6: [depends_on: [T2, T5]] Add API endpoints
T7: [depends_on: [T6]] Write integration tests
```

Tasks with empty/satisfied dependencies can run in parallel (T1, T2 above).

### 4. Save Plan

Save to `<topic>-plan.md` in the CWD.

### 5. Subagent Review

After saving, spawn a subagent to review the plan:

```
Review this implementation plan for:
1. Missing dependencies between tasks
2. Ordering issues that would cause failures
3. Missing error handling or edge cases
4. Gaps, holes, gotchas.

Provide specific, actionable feedback. Do not ask questions.

Plan location: [file path]
Context: [brief context about the task]
```

If the subagent provides actionable feedback, revise the plan before yielding.

**Generated**: [Date]
**Complexity**: [Low/Medium/High]

## Overview
[Summary of task and approach]

## Prerequisites
- [Tools, libraries, access needed]

## Dependency Graph

```
[Visual representation of task dependencies]
T1 ──┬── T3 ──┐
     │        ├── T5 ── T6 ── T7
T2 ──┴── T4 ──┘
```

## Tasks

### T1: [Name]
- **depends_on**: []
- **location**: [file paths]
- **description**: [what to do]
- **validation**: [how to verify]

### T2: [Name]
- **depends_on**: []
- **location**: [file paths]
- **description**: [what to do]
- **validation**: [how to verify]

### T3: [Name]
- **depends_on**: [T1]
- **location**: [file paths]
- **description**: [what to do]
- **validation**: [how to verify]

[... continue for all tasks ...]

## Parallel Execution Groups

| Wave | Tasks | Can Start When |
|------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | T1, T2 | Immediately |
| 2 | T3, T4 | Wave 1 complete |
| 3 | T5 | T3, T4 complete |
| ... | ... | ... |

## Testing Strategy
- [How to test]
- [What to verify]

## Risks & Mitigations
- [What could go wrong + how to handle]
```

## Important

- Every task must have explicit `depends_on` field
- Root tasks (no dependencies) can be executed in parallel immediately
- Do NOT implement - only create the plan
- Always use Context7 for external dependencies before finalizing tasks
